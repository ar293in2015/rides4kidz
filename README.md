App that me and 3 other team members created for a Uber Hackathon during my time at Coding Dojo. The objective of the Hackathon was to create an web app that was beneficial to the community. The web app also had to include the uber API.

RIDES4KIDZ
The app we created was called RIDES4KIDZ. Using this website, we set out to allow schools to sign up and share the page on social media or through emails in order to recieve donations. These donations would then be used to provide kids with rides home for after school programs who other wouldn't the means to make it home.
